                    <td class="TFSST">The Five Star Stories ("FSS") is a 21 year old serial story running monthly in the Japanese magazine, NewType. FSS ostensibly depicts the evolution of the God of Light, Amaterasu, in a universe marked by uneven technological and social advances. FSS is, however, equal parts epic space opera, military drama and character study.  Moreover, FSS's art is unusually elegant, complex and well-drawn among manga.</td>
